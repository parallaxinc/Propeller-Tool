# Propeller-Tool
Propeller Tool software for Windows - with P2 debug support

## Latest Status
The Propeller Tool was first released in 2006 with the production of the [Propeller 1 microcontroller](https://www.parallax.com/catalog/microcontrollers/propeller).  It enjoyed a very stable life since the 2012 release of v1.3.2.  Now with the release of the [Propeller 2 microcontroller](https://parallax.com/), the Propeller Tool is being updated to support it. 

The original project was not stored in a source code versioning system and Parallax does not have the rights to release the source for some of the critical third-party (yet Parallax-customized) components built into the Propeller tool.  For now, this repository serves as a place holder for future source and a repository of current [releases](https://github.com/parallaxinc/Propeller-Tool/releases) and [issues](https://github.com/parallaxinc/Propeller-Tool/issues).

If you are interested in the source code to the Spin2 compiler or the debug window functionality, you may find it in the [PNut Repository](https://github.com/parallaxinc/P2_PNut_Public).
